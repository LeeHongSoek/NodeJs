                        Before the RISC philosophy became prominent, many computer architects tried to bridge
                        the so called semantic gap, i.e. to design instruction sets that directly supported
                        high-level programming constructs such as procedure calls, loop control, and complex
                        addressing modes, allowing data structure and array accesses to be combined into
                        single instructions. Instructions are also typically highly encoded in order to
                        further enhance the code density...

                        Some aspects attributed to the first RISC-labeled designs around 1975 include the
                        observations that the memory-restricted compilers of the time were often unable
                        to take advantage of features intended to facilitate manual assembly coding, and
                        that complex addressing modes take many cycles to perform due to the required additional
                        memory accesses...

                        A database management system (DBMS) is a software package with computer programs
                        that control the creation, maintenance, and the use of a database. It allows organizations
                        to conveniently develop databases for various applications by database administrators
                        (DBAs) and other specialists. A database is an integrated collection of data records,
                        files, and other database objects...
